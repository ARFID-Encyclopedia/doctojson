Name: Apple
Visual: thin peel that can vary in color (red, green, pink, yellow, red/yellow, dark red). Inside is white, grainy. Might have some green “veins” on the white. Contains small to medium sized dark brown seeds at the core. 
Texture: the peel is dry and smooth. The inside (white) can feel a little bit rough and grainy to the tongue. Biting it will release juice (not as much as pears). The white part closer to the center is harder to bite than the “outside” or periphery. Apple texture can vary wildly based on age of apple, temperature of apple and kind. Some kinds like Mcintosh are soft and “fleshy”, and variants like gala and granny smith are harder, crisp and somewhat sharp. Apples like red delicious are dry and hard. Apples that have been refrigerated tend to be a bit more crisp/sharp than room temperature apples. An apple that is older can have a “mealy” texture: soft, dry and grainy.
Smell: perfume (alcohol-like). Apple scent usually isn’t particularly strong until the apple is bit into or cut up. A warmer apple will usually have a stronger scent.
Taste:  red apples: adstringent (?), faintly sweet, can be a little bitter or sour depending on the maturity. Green apples (USA): very sweet, tastes like pears but with a different texture (texture of an apple). Apples can range the gamut from incredibly to mildly sweet -- softer apples like Macintosh or Pink Lady tend to be sweeter, and more crisp apples like granny smith tend to be sharper.

Name: Banana
Visual: on the exterior green, then bright yellow, then yellow with brown spots, then brown, as banana ages. Inside, they are a pale yellow, and can have brown spots if bruised. The yellow darkens some as the banana gets older. Touching a peeled banana can leave your hands feeling somewhat sticky.
Texture: bananas are soft, and after being peeled often have stringy bits on the outside that run the length of the banana that can have a dry texture, and sometimes come free from the banana as you eat it. Older bananas that have browning peels are even softer, their texture becomes more buttery. Greener peel bananas have a firmer texture, though they are still incredibly soft. Some varieties of bananas may contain a slight grainy texture from very tiny seeds.
Smell: The smell of a banana becomes stronger as the banana ages, and is strongest at the top and the bottom of the banana peel. Scent is pretty even once peeled. A banana with a stronger scent smells more sweet and sugary.
Taste: mild but sweet, though the banana gets sweeter as it ages. Some bananas are sweeter than others.

Seedless grapes do not have that texture.
Smell: faint perfume (alcohol-like).

The rind is much thinner than watermelons so can be cut away completely to leave just the flesh. The rind often has a ‘webbed’ appearance with white lines over light green.
Texture: Dense, soft, can be slightly slimy depending on how ripe it is. Very juicy, kind of similar to pears but without being grainy at all. Can get slightly harder close to the rind. When not as ripe, honeydew are often harder and not very juicy.
Smell: Fruity, not too strong
Taste:  Very sweet, mild flavour. Never sour or bitter, will just taste more strongly sweet/melony as it ripens. Very different taste to rockmelon/cantaloupe.

Name: Pineapple
Visual: description.
Texture: soft and somewhat stringy, can occasionally have sharp barbs if eating fresh cut pineapple. If tinned much softer and less stringy. In areas where the fruit is bruised the texture softens. The very center of the pineapple is incredibly hard and dry, while the rest of the fruit is wet. In tinned pineapples, the fruit often floats in a liquid that can be syrupy.
Smell: strong, sweet and somewhat sharp. In an uncut pineapple it is strongest at the bottom of the fruit. Scent grows stronger when the pineapple is being cut up. Tinned pineapple smells overwhelmingly sweet.

Name: Raspberry
Visual: Small light red berry made up of lots of little bits connected together (similar to blackberries/boysenberries) to form a rounded cone with a hollow space in the middle (large enough to fit over a small finger). Each small bit has a small seed surrounded by pulp. 
Texture: Outside is slightly velvety (not smooth like blackberries). The small pieces are easily pulled apart from the rest of the berry into smaller chunks. The inside has fruity pulp and the seeds may bother some people, but they are not as bad as larger seeds like grape or watermelon. 
Smell: Fruity
Taste:  Fruity, sweet. One of the few fruits to taste quite similar to artificial products as they are candy-like. Safer than other fruits taste wise as they are never sour

Name: Walnuts

Texture: Similar to other nuts, hard but softer than some nuts. The flaky covering is papery and will sometimes get caught in your throat
Smell: No strong discernable smell
Taste:  Nutty, can be quite bitter. The darker the flaky covering the more bitter it will be generally (removing the covering as much as you can by hand can help lessen the bitterness)

Name: Watermelon
Visual: Large round fruit with a rind that is either very dark green or light green with darker green stripes. Sometimes has yellow areas where it has grown against the ground. Inside is pink to light red, fading to white as it goes to the rind. Some varieties are instead bright yellow inside. Some are seedless (will generally still have very small white immature seeds), normal ones will have both softer white seeds and hard light to dark brown ones. 
Texture: Very very juicy, ones that are ideal ripeness will be a bit crunchy, overripe ones will start to go softer. The juice is liable to run down your hands. Some can be a bit grainy/silty. The brown seeds are hard and some people swallow them but you can also spit them out. If the brown seeds get between your teeth as you chew they can split open. The white seeds are less hard and maybe very slightly slimy texture.
Smell: Fruity when cut
Taste:  Sweet but not too strong unless overripe. Taste changes a bit as you get closer to the rind (less sweet)

Name: Ciabatta
Visual: White loaf or bun/roll similar to standard white bread, but is generally handmade so it is more rounded. Has a crust but it is less thick than standard white bread and generally dusted with flour. Inside is cream/tan coloured with larger air pockets than standard white loaves. Lower quality ones will be just the same as white loaves inside. 
Texture: Soft but can be slightly more doughy inside. Different to standard white bread, kind of smoother/less dry inside (but isnt wet/damp or anything). Goes stale faster than standard bread and will get really hard when it does. Toasts well but slightly differently to standard bread
Smell: Yeasty
Taste:  Very similar to standard white bread but with a slight sourdough like taste (not as strong as standard sourdough breads)

Name: Corn Cereals (Kellog’s, etc)
Visual: Typically tan or brown, some are dyed to look different.
Texture: dry and crunchy (eaten without milk).
Smell: there is no smell associated with them
Taste:  Depends on the kind. Plain rice chex/corn flakes have a very mild taste. They’re typically very tolerable. Other kinds may have specific flavors, such as cinnamon, or honey. Because the plain cereal is so mild the taste of the flavor is the only taste you’re likely to notice.

Name: Salmon (cooked)
Visual: Pinky orange fish with white stripes, gets lighter in colour as it cooks. Can be as pieces of fish with the skin attached or as cubes with the skin unattached (cooks best with the skin attached). Can have a thin layer of brown between the meat and the skin. Can come either deboned or with small bones still inside. The skin is like the outside of a fish- they will generally be descaled but sometimes there are still a few lightly stuck to it. 
Texture: Similar to other fish but more fibrous/stringy? More similar texture to other meats like chicken than standard white fish meat is. Depends on the type but some the white stripes can be more prominent/stringy (fresh New Zealand caught ones are) whereas in others it’s not really discernable from the rest of the meat (atlantic, thawed from frozen). If there is a layer of brown between the meat and the skin this will often stick to the meat when you seperate it from the skin, and it can be kind of gelatinous and will be sticky if it gets on your fingers. Easy enough to scrape from the meat with a fork or knife though
Smell: Fishy
Taste:  Fishy, but different to white fish meat. Kind of a unique taste. Stronger taste than fresh white fish

Name: Artichoke (steamed or boiled)
Visual: Dark green unopened flower. Large, at least fist sized usually. Made up of leafy ‘scales’ in layers that have a small amount of flesh on each one. In the middle the ‘scales’ get smaller and thinner, ending in a collection of fibrous ‘thistles’ in a circular pattern. Once the thistles are scraped away (inedible) the artichoke heart is left, which looks like a shallow dish on a stem.
Texture: The flesh on the inside of the ‘scales’ is soft and mushy, it is scraped away using your teeth. Can be slightly harder depending on how long it’s been cooked (but should be at least softish). There is a thin layer of whiter flesh over green which can be smooth on top. The artichoke heart is more dense and gets more stringy the closer to the stem. The stem is very stringy (but edible) and may have small bits of leaf still attached. 
Smell: Not too strong, but depending on your genes may make your pee smell strongly (same as asparagus does)
Taste:  Unique, the only thing it is similar to is asparagus. Not super bitter or anything. Commonly eaten dipped in melted butter/margarine (but doesn’t have to be)
